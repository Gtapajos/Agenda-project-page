						Business Rules are statements (or conditions) that tell a person whether they can perform a specific action that relates to how the business operates. Business rules also supply the criteria and conditions for making these decisions.<br>
						In other words, business rules are statements defining or limiting any side of the software development. They often involve very specific criteria or conditions for compliance.<br>

						A data dictionary is a collection of metadata such as object name, data type, size, classification, and relationships with other data assets. Think of it as a list along with a description of tables, fields, and columns. The primary goal of a data dictionary is to help data teams understand data assets.

                        According to IBM's Computer Terminology Dictionary, a data dictionary is a ‚Äúcentralized repository of information about data such as meaning, relationships to other data, origin, usage, and format. It assists management, database administrators, system analysts, and application programmers in planning, controlling, and evaluating the collection, storage, and use of data.‚Äù

						User Experience (UX) is the holistic journey users traverse as they use a product. Not only does it include their direct interactions with the product, but also how it fits in with their overall task completion process.<br>

                        Regardless of whether different aspects of the experience are under the direct control of the product or are merely associated with the product, the total experience is considered part of the UX from the user‚Äôs perspective. Every touchpoint between the customer and the company is included in the total User Experience.<br>

						Entity Relationship Diagram, also known as ERD, ER Diagram or ER model, is a type of structural diagram for use in database design. An ERD contains different symbols and connectors that visualize two important information: The major entities within the system scope, and the inter-relationships among these entities.

                        And that's why it's called "Entity" "Relationship" diagram (ERD).<br>

                        When we talk about entities in ERD, very often we are referring to business objects such as people/roles (e.g. Student), tangible business objects (e.g. Product), intangible business objects (e.g. Log), etc. "Relationship" is about how these entities relate to each other within the system.

						An use case diagram is a dynamic or behavior diagram in UML. Use case diagrams model the functionality of a system using actors and use cases. Use cases are a set of actions, services, and functions that the system needs to perform. In this context, a "system" is something being developed or operated, such as a web site. The "actors" are people or entities operating under defined roles within the system.<br>

						Clearly defined requirements are essential signs on the road that leads to a successful project. They establish a formal agreement between a client and a provider that they are both working to reach the same goal.<br>Functional requirements define what a product must do, what its features and functions are. Nonfunctional requirements describe the general properties of a system. They are also known as quality attributes.<br>

						The C4 model can be explained as a map. Maps can be drawn with a different scale. By changing scales, for example, you can have a world map with countries and continents or a town map with streets and buildings. Like so, the C4 model differentiates the level of a diagram to depict software architecture. Using the abstraction-first approach, C4 conducts modeling top-down from system context to lower levels.<br>
